            <div>
              All bidders must be approved to participate in the Premier Auction. To apply, submit a
              brief application and two references if applicable. Our team will review your
              application, contact you within 24 hours if additional information is needed, and
              notify you of your approval. This process can take several days, so please submit your
              application early. Applications are reviewed more quickly on the final day of the
              auction, so please still submit your application even on the final day of the auction
              and we will do our best to review it in time for you to place a bid before closing.
              After you receive approval to bid in the Premier Auction, there is no limit on your
              purchases as a new bidder.

            <div>
              Approved bidders can start to bid as soon as the auction is live and the bidding tool
              is activated. All bids are entered using the maximum bid model. Bids will be submitted
              in fixed increments only. Bids will be accepted until 7:00 p.m. PT on the closing
              night of the auction. Then, at 7:00 p.m. PT, extended bidding will start (see details
              below). If you are the only bidder on an item when the auction closes, you will be
              declared the winner.

            <Header>How do maximum bids work?</Header>
            <LineBreak />
            <div>
              All bids are placed using the "maximum bid" model, which typically represents the
              highest price the bidder is willing to pay for an item. When a bidder places a maximum
              bid, the bid will automatically increase competitively, up to but never over, the
              maximum bid amount. You will be notified if you are the highest bidder, if you've been
              outbid, and if you've won the item. Maximum bids are private and are only viewable by
              the client that submitted the bid. PWCC does not have access to this information and
              cannot view biddersâ€™ maximum bids. Maximum bid information is managed on dedicated IT
              infrastructure and is contractually monitored by an external IT firm. Third-party
              management of maximum bids ensures the privacy and confidentiality of maximum bid
              amounts. The IT firm audits access to the data to confirm that no PWCC personnel ever
              have access to this information.

              From 7:00 - 8:00 p.m., bids are extended for 5 minutes. Each time a new bid is placed,

              The extended bidding timer is accelerated twice, after 8:00 p.m. and again after 8:30

              and when the first bid is placed after 8:30 p.m., the timer will reset to 1 minute.

              A buyer's premium equal to 20% of the winning bid amount will be added to the final

              plus 20% of that winning bid, plus applicable taxes and shipping costs. The buyer's
              premium is not reflected in the maximum bid in the auction bidding tool.

            The Weekly Auction uses an extended bidding model (patent pending) that allows you to
            participate in a fast-paced, competitive, and friendly auction-closing experience.
            Extended bidding ensures that the bidder willing to pay the most wins while closing the
            auction as quickly as possible to keep the experience secure and professional.

              No, we do not permit third-party sniping services, but do allow maximum bids to be
              placed throughout the course of the auction. If you place a max bid, it will also
              carry over into extended bidding as long it remains above the highest current bid. You
              may also place a max bid during extended bidding. Max bids are kept strictly
              confidential with third-party IT firewalling and encryption and additional third-party
              cybersecurity monitoring and process auditing. Maximum bids placed with PWCC leverage
              the most secure software system in the market.
